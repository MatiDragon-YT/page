# Enchanti IDE

Enchanti IDE is a powerful tool to make cross-platform CLEO Scripts for GTA San Andreas, with a syntax based on SB4 and JS.

The whole project is in HTML, CSS and Native JS. Everything runs from the browser, without making strange requests to the server, other than just to download files needed for a smooth, fast and stable experience.
